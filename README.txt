# Industrial atmospheric emission inventory – Brazil
The industrial sectors inventoried in Brazil were petrol refinery (16), cement industries (96), paper and cellulose industries (64), and thermoelectric power plants (1730) that use as fuel: natural gas, diesel, coal, fuel oil, and bagasse. 
Further information about methodology and additional data can be obtained in the manuscript published at https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08281-7.

All_sources_and_pollutants.txt file contains the geographic coordinates of each emission source. Also, it includes the emission for a lower and upper limit and the average between them for CO, CO2, NOx, SOx, TOC, and PM in Gg/year for the base year of 2011.
All_sources_pollutant*.txt files contain each emission source's geographic coordinates, the emission for a lower and upper limit, and the average between them for one of the evaluated pollutants (CO, CO2, NOx, SOx, TOC, and PM).
Sector_*.txt files contain emissions for a lower and upper limit and the average between them for CO, CO2, NOx, SOx, TOC, and PM in Gg/year by the industrial sector inventoried.
